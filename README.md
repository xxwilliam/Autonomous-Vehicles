 <p><b>Autonomous Vehicles by William Hansen.</b></p>
 
 
<p>What is an Autonomous Vehicle?In simple terms it is a vehicle that drives by itself, with little or no human interaction. Along a predetermined path in <b>“auto pilot”.</b> And a terms it is a vehicle that drives by itself, with a predetermined program to get there safely. Autonomous Vehicles have come a long way. Experiments started in the 1920’s, and trials began in the 1950’s. Jump to 1977 for example, the 1st semi-automated vehicle was developed by Japan’s Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering lab. And that vehicle drove along a specially designed street with a top speed of 30 klms (19 mph). On an elevated rail. The tech back then was an analog computer and 2 cameras. Fast forward to the 5th of march, 2021, Honda introduced a limited edition<b> Legend Hybrid EX.</b> With a level 3 Automated driving , (See below for the different levels). But this vehicle was discontinued in June 2021. The technology involved is a range of different systems, including navigation systems, location systems, the global path planning, environment perception, laser perception, laser perception, radar perception,
 visual perception, vehicle control system.</p>
 <p>All vehicles will need some form of machine vision, Eg (meaning it is a technology used to provide imaging-based analysis), and also some will have deep neural networks. Deep learning methods are based on artificial neural networks with representation learning, it can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. The neural network depends on an extensive amount of data extracted from (real life driving). There are 5 (but if you count level 0 then it's 6) levels of driving automation.</p>

<p> <b>Level 0.</b> Warning systems may monentinarly intervene but no sustained vehicle control, Reversing cameras, speedo checks.</p>
<p> <b>Level 1.</b> (hands on) Driver controls steering and automated system controls speed or engine and brake power, eg cruise control.</p>
<p> <b>Level 2.</b> (hands off) Automated system has full control of vehicle, eg speed,braking and steering, but the driver has to be prepared to intervene immediately if the system fails to respond properly.</p>
<p> <b>Level 3.</b> (Eyes Off) The driver can text, or watch a movie and the vehicle will handle situations that call for immediate attention, eg emergency braking. The driver must still intervene within a short time.</p>
 <p><b>Level 4.</b> (mind off). Same as level 3, but no driver attention required for safety. This is for vehicles in spatial areas ( geofenced) or under special circumstances.</p>
<p> <b>Level 5.</b> (Steering wheel optional), No human intervention needed,sit back and enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>Full Autonomous Vehicles are a long way (decades) from being commercially viable as more technology is needed to ensure the
safety of the public. What technology and other development needed to make this possible? More powerful sensors, actuators,
complex algorithms, machine learning systems,and processors to execute software. Some safety and security cameras, AI,network infrastructure ,radar and lidar.</p>
